# Data-Cleaning-Project
Demonstrate data cleaning to make a tidy data set.

This repository is for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It has the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

Dataset
Represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, labelled as UCI HAR Dataset. 

This repo contains the following:

1.) CodeBook.md - a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

2.) run_analysis.R - demonstrate how to collect, work with, and clean a data set, to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis by:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in the previous step, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

3.) TidyData.txt is the resulting independent tidy data set.
